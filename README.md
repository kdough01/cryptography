# cryptography

Detailing my plans for the repository over the coming months below.

I will be working on turning some of these funcitons into classes and expanding some of their functionality.

I'd like to simulate some qubits and quantum algorithms in this repository as well. I have some preliminary code written up for a quantum random number generator, but I'm going to expand upon the functionality before pushing it here.

I need to expand the test suite, this was only an afterthought at the moment.

Elliptic Curves:
Specifically with Elliptic Curves I'd like the addition and addition over finite field to be easier to use from a user perspective and the points to be defined as objects of the class.

Lattices:
Will also be re-programming the lattice algorithms in C.

Right now most of the algorithms in this repository can be found in An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography by Hoffstein, Pipher, and Silverman.
